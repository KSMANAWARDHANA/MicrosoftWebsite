                       There are always a multitude of <a href="#" className="font-normal text-blue-600 hover:underline">design considerations</a>when you build out an application infrastructure in Azure. These aspects of a VM are important to think about before you start:

                             <ul className="mt-4 ml-10 list-none md:list-disc font-semibold">
                               <li > The names of your application resources</li> 
                               <li >The location where the resources are stored</li>
                               <li >The size of the VM</li>
                               <li >The maximum number of VMs that can be created</li>
                               <li >The operating system that the VM runs</li>
                               <li >The configuration of the VM after it starts</li>
                               <li >The related resources that the VM needs</li>
                             </ul>
                       </p>

                        {/*Paragraph Three*/}

                        <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl mt-1">Locations</h1>
                        <p className="mt-4 text-black leading-relaxed">

                        There are multiple <a href="#" className="font-normal text-blue-600 hover:underline">geographical regions</a> around the world where you can create Azure resources. Usually, the region is called location when you create a VM. For a VM, the location specifies where the virtual hard disks will be stored.

                         This table shows some of the ways you can get a list of available locations.
                          
                        </p>

                        {/*Paragraph Four*/}

                        <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl mt-1">Availability</h1>
                        <p>Azure announced an industry leading single instance virtual machine Service Level Agreement of 99.9% provided you deploy the VM with premium storage for all disks. In order for your deployment to qualify for the standard 99.95% VM Service Level Agreement, you still need to deploy two or more VMs running your workload inside of an availability set. An availability set ensures that your VMs are distributed across multiple fault domains in the Azure data centers as well as deployed onto hosts with different maintenance windows. The full Azure SLA explains the guaranteed availability of Azure as a whole.</p>

                       {/*Paragraph Five*/}
                       <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl mt-1">VM Size</h1>
                       <p className="mt-4 text-black leading-relaxed">
                       The size of the VM that you use is determined by the workload that you want to run. The size that you choose then determines factors such as processing power, memory, and storage capacity. Azure offers a wide variety of sizes to support many types of uses.
                       Azure charges an hourly price based on the VMâ€™s size and operating system. For partial hours, Azure charges only for the minutes used. Storage is priced and charged separately.
